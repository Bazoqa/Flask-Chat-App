## Milestone 3 Readme

1. Why did you choose to test the code that you did? (details in rubric)
I chose to test the code that I did because they analyzed typeErrors and allowed me to make sure that data was properly being modified by the functions of my program. There were many functions that took an input, used it to modify existing data, and send a socket emit to update client(s). Because there were so many moving parts, it was important to test the input data thorouhgly and how it affected my database.

2. Is there anything else you would like to test if you had the time (or was asked to do so)?
I would have liked to test the Goolge Login Functionality if possible, even if its mostly taken care of in React.
